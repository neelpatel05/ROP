Goal - to execute "cat /etc/passwd"

To achieve goal:
1) Find the memory we can write "cat /etc/passwd"
2) Fing a function that can write to the memory

1)
Do objdump -x to find out the space used by the binary
 - .dynamic has 208 (d0) bytes free. Thus it is a good location for storing the "cat /etc/passwd" (cmd)
 - .dynamic address = 0x08049530

2) Find a function that can write "cat /etc/passwd" to the memory address at 0x08049530

We have read() and write() function available in the binary.
read() function can be used to read the data from the socket and write it to memory
read() function has 3 parameters. stdin, buffer, length

read() address = 0x0804832c (objdump -D ./rop | grep read)
write() address = 0x8048442 (objdump -D ./rop | grep write)

3) We need to find system() address and pass written "cat /etc/passwd" on buffer to the system function
